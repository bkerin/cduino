<h1>Cduino Manual</h1>

<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

First take a look at
<a href="http://brittonkerin.com/cduino/home_page.html#abstract">the abstract
</a> on the home page.
<p />
The individual module APIs are documented
<a href="apis_and_sources.html">here</a>.
<p />

The common code (make plus a bit of perl) required to compile and upload
programs lives in the top-level directory.  Modules live in their own
subdirectories and link into the top level directory and each other as needed.
For example, if a module needs to use serial communication, it will contain
symbolic links to the serial communication implementation and headers in the
uart module.  The uart module itself contains both the uart interface and
implementation, and a demonstration program showing how to use the interface.
The overall architecture is thus more <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal</a>
than hierarchical.  This is a convenient arrangement for microcontrollers,
where the target is often a self-contained or mostly self-contained system.

<h2 id="extending">Basic Strategies for Using and Modifying</h2>

To start making your own stand-along program without caring about the rest of
Cduino:
<p />

<ol>

  <li>Do <code>cp --recursive --dereference some_module ~/new_program</code>
  where <code>some_module</code> is the one that already comes closest to doing
  what you want.</li>

  <li>Grab code from other modules as needed and mix it in.  Note that you are
  responsible for keeping track of the dependencies of this additional code.
  Generally this means checking for included headers and their corresponding
  source files, which should appear as symbolic links in the other module's
  subdirectories.</li>

</ol>

<p />
To add a new module to Cduino (a nice thing to do for others):

<ol>

  <li> Starting from the distribution top level directory, do this:
  <blockquote>
    <code>make new_module NEW_MODULE_NAME=my_module_name</code>
  </blockquote>

  <li><code>cd my_module_name</code></li>

  <li> Link (<code>ln -s</code>) to existing headers and sources in other
  modules as needed.</li>

  <li>Write a program that exercises the module using the simplest possible
  hardware setup.  This is the program that the writeflash target will put on
  the chip when built in your module's subdirectory.</li>

  <li> Put comments in the module Makefile or give it a README in which you say
  what it does or give a pointer to that information, and describe any hardware
  required to exercise the module effectively.</li>

</ol>

<h2>generic.mk: What it Assumes and What it Provides</h2>

The code in generic.mk contains most of the voodoo required to compile and
upload C code for the arduino.  There are sensible defaults for all settings.
The simplest possible Makefile for a module consists of a single line:
<code>include generic.mk</code> (where <code>generic.mk</code> is a symbolic
link to the file generic.mk in the distribution top-level directory).
<p />

To disable some troublesome crufty old Make behavior, the -R option must be
passed to all make invocations that use <code>generic.mk</code>.

The <code>generic.mk</code> file provides the following targets intended for
public use:

<ul>

  <li><code>writeflash</code> -- Compile all .c files into object files using
  settings appropriate for Arduino ardware, link them, and upload them using
  the arduino bootloader method.  All <code>.c</code> files are assumed to
  depend on all headers and on the Makefile (so everything is recompiled if
  anything has changed).</li>

  <li><code>replace_bootloader</code> -- replace the bootloader on the ATMega
  on the arduino.  This is useful if an upload method that nukes the bootloader
  has been used (see below).</li>

</ul>

So by default, you just write your code and type <code>make -R
  writeflash</code> in your module subdirectory.  You may not need to know any
further details.
<p />

If more control is needed, there are a number of Make variables that affect how
generic.mk behaves.  These occur in sections marked "Overridable" in that file.

<h3>Variable Overview</h3>

There are a number of variables that have default values which can be
completely overridden by assigned your own values before
<code>generic.mk</code> is included or as variable assignment arguments to
make:

<ul>

  <li><code>COMPILER_MCU</code> -- The AVR microcontroller part name as known
  by the avr-gcc compiler.  With only minimal variable settings, other parts
  besides the atmega328p that ships with newish arduinos can be
  programmed using this make setup.</li>

  <li><code>PROGRAMMER_MCU</code> -- The AVR microcontroll part name as known
  by the avrdude uploader program.</li>

  <li><code>CPU_FREQ_DEFINE</code> -- A define which sets the F_CPU macro,
  which AVR libc uses.  With some tweaking of this variable and the fuse
  settings, parts running at other frequencies besides the default can be
  programmed using this make setup.</li>

  <li><code>PROGNAME</code> -- The basename of the binary output file that will
  be uploaded.  By default the basename is <code>program_to_upload</code>.
  </li>

  <li><code>OBJS</code> -- space-delimited list of object files to be created
  and linked together.  By default one object file is required for each
  <code>.c</code> file (or symbolic link to a <code>.c</code> file) in the
  module directory.</li>

  <li><code>HEADERS</code> -- space-delimited list of headers used by the
  <code>.c</code> files from which the object files are produced.  By default,
  all <code>.c</code> files depend on all header files found in the module
  directory.</li>

  <li id="upload_method"><code>UPLOAD_METHOD</code> -- This must be either
  "arduino_bl" or "AVRISPmkII".  The defualt is "arduino_bl", meaning that the
  program should be uploaded over the USB/serial line using the arduino
  bootloader.  The AVRISPmkII method instead expects to find an AVRISPmkII
  device and uses that.  Note that this latter method overwrites the Arduino
  bootloader, which will have to be replaced (probably using the
  replace_bootloader target; see above) before the arduino_bl method can be
  used again.  This setting may be useful for migrating to a stand-alone
  (non-arduino) design.</li>

  <li><code>DTR_PULSE_NOT_REQUIRED</code> -- If this is set to "true", the DTR
  pulse that the arduino normall uses to save the user having to push the reset
  button immediately after avrdude programming begins is not considered
  essential (os the perl modules used to do it aren't required).  Of course,
  now you will have to push the reset button all the time.</li>

  <li>build and upload program variables -- a number of variables exist which
  allow the compiler, uploader, etc. programs to bet set (e.g. CC, AVRDUDE,
  etc.).  These are useful if you want to test the effects of different
  compiler or uploader versions.</li>

  <li><code>LOCK_AND_FUSE_SETTINGS</code> -- This variable can be used to set
  the lock and fuse bytes of the arduino (normally they are left alone).  Doing
  so is required for the use of different clock frequencies, clock sources,
  power management, brown-out detection, watchdog timer, and other hardware
  features.  However, certain settings are required for normal arduino
  functionality, so changing them may break things.  They can hopefully be
  reset using the replace_bootloader target, but this is not guaranteed.  For
  example, setting the clock source to the low-frequency low-power internal
  oscillator makes the chips unprogrammable for me.</li>

  <li><code>AVRLIBC_PRINTF_LDFLAGS</code> -- This variable can be used to get a
  more feature-complete (and bigger) or more minimal (and smaller)
  implementation of <code>printf()</code> and friends.  By default, most
  <code>printf()</code> features are supported, with the notable exception of
  floating point output.  See the comments in the <code>generic.mk</code> for
  details.</li>

  <li><code>CPP_DEBUG_DEFINE_FLAGS</code> -- This can be used to pass define
  options to the C preprocessor to enable conditional debugging sections or the
  like.</li>

</ul>

There are also variables that can usefully be augmented by adding your own
values to them somewhere: 

<ul>

  <li><code>CPPFLAGS</code> -- Add your own C preprocessor flags (include
  directories, defines, etc.).</li>

  <li><code>CFLAGS</code> -- Add you own C compiler flags (more waring options,
  etc.).</li>

  <li><code>CXXFLAGS</code> -- Add your own C++ compiler flags.</li>

  <li><code>VALID_ARDUINOLESS_TARGET_PATTERNS</code> -- Add new files or file
  patterns which should be buildable even when no Arduino is connected (so you
  can for example get syntax fixes finnished without an Arduino).  Note that
  many normal patterns are already included (%.o, %.out, etc.), but this can
  be useful if you are adding your own rules for different file types.  This
  variable must be assigned to before <code>generic.mk</code> is included (or
  given as a variable assignment argument to make at the command line). </li>

</ul>
