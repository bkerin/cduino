FIXME: at the moment the uart.h interface is biased towards line buffered
interactive communication.  It should get some more general functions.

This module requires no hardware other than the arduino and its USB cable.

The stdiodemo.c program shows how to set up an AVR libc FILE stream to
communicate with the microcontroller over the serial line.  The program
accepts commands of the form 'u some_string' and simply returns the string.

The Makefile contains an interactive target run_screen which can be used
from a terminal on the linux side to talk to the microcontroller.  See the
Makefile for details.
