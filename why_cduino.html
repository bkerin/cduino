  <h1>Why Cduino</h1>

  To me the glory of microcontrollers is not the fact that they cost $2, its
  the fact that they are simple enough that you can have a decent idea of
  everything they are doing, and what they will be doing the next microsecond.
  The arduino project does an amazing job of making a $5 microcontroller feel
  something like a $50 PC10 type platform, but in doing so they have lost a bit
  of the simplicity.  The culprit is not the arduino hardware but the software
  language layers (wiring and C++) that are used to program the hardware.  
  <p />

  The cduino project also tries to make it simpler to migrate from the arduino
  to simpler hardware setups, in particular those that lack a USB serial
  interface and bootloader.  This may be interesting to users for whom cost
  definately is a factor.
